  "summary": "The diff implements chat system status management (REQ-2, REQ-3) with backend storage, admin controls, and client-side status display. However, the typing indicator implementation (REQ-1) is only simulated client-side with setTimeout logic and lacks true bidirectional communication between users.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Display a typing indicator in the chat interface when the other party is actively typing a message - bidirectional functionality",
      "reason": "The typing indicator is simulated using local setTimeout logic without actual backend communication. The code shows 'setIsTyping' state management and timeout-based detection, but no mechanism sends typing status to the backend or retrieves it from the other party. Comments like '// Set typing indicator (simulated - in real app would send to backend)' confirm this is not truly implemented.",
