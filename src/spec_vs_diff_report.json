  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements: message timestamps (REQ-1), read receipts (REQ-2), theme toggle (REQ-3), and professional design improvements (REQ-4). Timestamps are displayed using formatMessageTime utility in both AdminChatPanel and ChatWidget. Read receipt icons (Check/CheckCheck from lucide-react) are present in both chat components. A ThemeToggle component with ThemeProvider context is integrated into AdminPanel and ClientDashboard headers. Professional design improvements are evident through refined CSS color system (OKLCH), enhanced spacing/typography in tailwind.config.js, and improved component styling across index.css.",
