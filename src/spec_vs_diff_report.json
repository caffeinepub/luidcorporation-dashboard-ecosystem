  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements. REQ-2 (refresh button) is fully implemented with visible button, refetch logic, loading state, and data update. REQ-1 (remember-me fix) shows evidence of remember-me usage in the refresh handler but the actual fix to the login flow is not visible in the truncated diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the remember-me functionality to properly save authentication state to localStorage when checked and sessionStorage when unchecked",
      "reason": "The diff shows remember-me state being read from localStorage in handleRefresh, but does not show the actual implementation of the fix in the login flow (ClientLogin.tsx shows login page description but implementation is truncated). Cannot confirm if the login properly saves to localStorage vs sessionStorage based on checkbox state.",
