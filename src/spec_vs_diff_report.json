  "summary": "The diff implements all 7 requirements: backend adds OS (Windows/Ubuntu) and planExpiry fields to ClientRecord with migration support; frontend adds OS dropdown and date picker to ClientRegistrationForm and ClientEditModal; ClientDashboard conditionally displays SshInstructionsCard for Ubuntu or RdpInstructionsCard for Windows; ClientProfileMenu displays plan name and formatted expiration date. All CRUD operations handle the new fields correctly.",
