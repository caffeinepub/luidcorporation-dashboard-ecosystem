# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add comprehensive access logging, database export functionality, enhanced login UX with error handling and loading effects, copy-to-clipboard buttons, footer links, and premium visual effects to the LuidCorporation Dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Create an 'Activity Logs' section in the Admin Panel displaying Client ID, timestamp, and IP address for each login
- Add an 'Export Database' button in the Admin Panel that downloads all client data as JSON or CSV
- Display a styled red error alert when an invalid Client ID is entered during login
- Add a green neon loading effect to the login button during authentication
- Add copy buttons with clipboard icons next to IP address, username, and password fields in the Client Dashboard
- Add 'Terms of Use' and 'Privacy Policy' links in the Client Dashboard footer with placeholder content
- Apply a green glow effect to information cards throughout the application
- Add a green indicator dot to the Support Chat widget showing 'High Availability' status

**User-visible outcome:** Admins can monitor client access logs and export the complete database. Clients experience improved login feedback with error messages and loading indicators, can easily copy credentials with one-click buttons, access legal information links in the footer, and enjoy enhanced visual aesthetics with glowing cards and a high-availability support indicator.
