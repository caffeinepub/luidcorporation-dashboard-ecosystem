# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add VM status management, support chat functionality, and admin profile display to the Luid Corporation Dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Add VM status field (online/offline/maintenance) to each client record with admin controls to modify status
- Display VM status indicator on client dashboard with color-coded visual styling
- Implement floating chat widget on client dashboard for support conversations
- Add chat management interface in admin panel to view and respond to client messages
- Display logged-in administrator's name/profile in admin panel header

**User-visible outcome:** Admins can monitor and update VM status for each client, manage support conversations through a built-in chat system, and see their profile displayed in the admin panel. Clients can view their VM status and communicate with support via a floating chat widget.
