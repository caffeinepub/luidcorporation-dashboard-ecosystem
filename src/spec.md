# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add real-time typing indicators and online/offline status management to the chat system.

**Planned changes:**
- Display typing indicator in chat interface when the other party is actively typing
- Add online/offline status indicator for chat in the admin panel
- Provide admin controls to toggle chat status between online and offline
- Show appropriate message to clients when chat is offline

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see when someone is typing in the chat, and admins can control whether the chat is available (online/offline) with status clearly visible in the admin panel. Clients will see when chat is unavailable.
